Notes for Episode 2:

    Installed packages:

    Important URLs:
        create API key in OpenAI:
            https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
        


    Important Commands:

        Terminal Commands:
            npm i --save openai


    Important Note Points:
        Environment variables:
            1.  To save environment variables, create .env file
            2.  All names in the file must be prefixed with REACT_APP

        Memoizing:
            1. Instead of making fetch call directly by calling getTrailerKey (in useMovieTrailer hook), we will first check if (!trailerVideoKey)
            2. This way, We will only make the fetch call once (for every reload when redux store becomes empty). 
            3. And for every page changes, the fetch call need not be made, hence a great optimization with significantly reduced number of fetches.

    Notes:
        1.  GPT APIs are the APIs provided by OpenAI, ChatGPT is the UI on top of those APIs.
            In this app, we will use those underlying GPT APIs for movie Recommendations.
