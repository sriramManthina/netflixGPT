    Notes:
        In index.js, create-react-app automatically gives the code:
        <React.StrictMode>
            <App />
        </React.StrictMode>

        for react-StrictMode, due to this many events like fetch calls, redux operations happens twice (during development)
        however during production it will only happen once. To remove this feature just take out React.StrictMode tags

        React does this twice to compare the renders and throw errors if there are any inconsistencies (its a good thing)
